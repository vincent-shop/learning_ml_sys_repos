# The Art of Debugging (submodule)

This folder vendors **The Art of Debugging** as a git submodule:

- **Upstream**: `https://github.com/stas00/the-art-of-debugging`
- **Local path**: `examples/the-art-of-debugging/the-art-of-debugging`

## What it is

An evolving open book by Stas Bekman on debugging methodologies and tools.
The goals:
1. **Debug normal issues really fast**
2. **Make complicated issues possible to debug**

Covers debugging compiled programs, Python, PyTorch, and general Unix tools.

## Start here (inside the submodule)

- `the-art-of-debugging/README.md` — table of contents

## Topics covered

- **Fast Debugging Methodology** — `methodology/`
- **Debugging Compiled Programs** — `compiled-programs/` (gdb, ldd, nm, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.)
- **Debugging Python** — `python/` (py-spy, paths, auto-print, etc.)
- **Debugging PyTorch** — `pytorch/` (CPU/GPU memory, performance, models, tensors)
- **Unix Tools For Debugging** — `unix/` (bash, strace, make, nohup, etc.)

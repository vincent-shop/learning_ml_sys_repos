# Examples

Code examples for modern AI workloads and ML systems, with a focus on practical, grounded training workflows.

## Focus Areas

### Training & Fine-tuning
Primary focus on introducing training in a meaningful way:
- **TRL Examples**: RLHF and related training techniques for language models
- **Fine-tuning Workflows**: Task-specific model adaptation
- **Training Infrastructure**: Pipelines, data handling, and experiment management

### Additional Workloads
Future examples: inference optimization, data processing, model evaluation, and MLOps.

## Getting Started

Each example includes documentation, setup instructions, dependencies, and best practices.
